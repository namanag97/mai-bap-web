<span className="prose-lead">Two years ago, we set out to build the process intelligence platform we wished existed. One that doesn't require a six-month consulting engagement to configure, treats conformance as an operational metric rather than a quarterly audit, and gives engineers the same visibility into business processes that APM tools give into code. Today, we're releasing Meridian 2.0.</span>

## What's new in 2.0

Meridian 2.0 introduces three major capabilities that fundamentally change how teams understand and optimize their processes.

### Real-time conformance checking

Every case is now evaluated against your reference model in real time. Deviations are flagged immediately — not hours later in a batch report. This changes when you intervene: you act while a case is still in progress, not after it closes.

### Automated root cause analysis

When a case deviates, Meridian 2.0 automatically identifies the most likely root cause using a combination of process variant analysis and ML-based attribution. It surfaces the specific sequence of activities that led to the deviation — no manual drill-down required.

### Automation Studio v2

Build automation workflows directly on top of your process model. Trigger alerts, route cases, escalate exceptions, and invoke external APIs — all through a visual, no-code interface that understands process state.

## Availability

Meridian 2.0 is available today for all Pro and Enterprise customers. Free tier users will get access to real-time conformance checking on March 1, 2026.
