<span className="prose-lead">TechCorp processes 15,000 purchase orders per month across 12 regional offices. Before Meridian, their operations team manually reviewed every exception case flagged by their ERP system — a process that consumed 40% of analyst time.</span>

## The problem

Most exceptions followed predictable patterns. The same root causes appeared in roughly 80% of cases. Yet each one required a human to open the case, diagnose it, and route it for resolution — often only to find it was the same issue they'd seen yesterday.

## The approach

Using Meridian's variant analysis, the team identified 6 exception patterns that accounted for 78% of all deviations. They built automation workflows for each one: automatic routing, approval triggers, and escalation rules based on SLA thresholds.

## Results after 90 days

- 47% reduction in average case resolution time
- 78% of exceptions now handled without manual review
- Analyst time redirected to complex edge cases and process improvement
- 12% reduction in overall process cycle time
